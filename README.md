# Algorithms
This Repository is my personal testing ground, where I will practice algorithm challenges, ranging from easy to difficult. As of July 2020, I'm starting off with practicing algorithms in Java. I'm choosing Java first because I've heard it is the most commonly used programming language in technical interviews. Unless the position is very specific, the candidate can generally request to use a language of their choosing.

The next languages I would use to practice Algorithms in are JavaScript, Python, C, and PHP. Heres giving it my best shot!
