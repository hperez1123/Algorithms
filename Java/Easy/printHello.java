public class Solution {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World.");

// While it was correct on HackerRank, I have to note that running

/*
 * Breaking it down, I see that in Java, a class must be called. I understand
 * that it can either be public, private, or protected. after making designating
 * the object's class type, we call it Solution.
 * 
 * we open start {} after Solution. Inside is [public static void main(String[]
 * args)], where main() is the method of the program. public static void is the
 * method's modifiers. Static helps with memory. (String[] args) designates that
 * incoming argument are strings. Notes have more indepth explanation.
